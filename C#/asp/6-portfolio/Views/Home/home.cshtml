			<p>"Coding is like walking up an escalator that moves in the polar opposite of your direction. You keep walking and never stop." - Tony Morris

			I'm Tony Morris, Full-stack Web Developer.

			I code in C, C++, C#, Java, Lua, Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript . I'm familiar with various frameworks and web technologies such as Flask, Django, Spring, ASP.NET, Angular and AJAX.

			Iâ€™m passionate about passing on my coding knowledge to others, breaking down complex concepts into simple ones that even non-coders can understand. I'm driven to learn, staying on my toes with the latest Web Technologies in this ever-changing industry.

			If i'm not knees deep into coding one of my own projects, you'll find me willingly offering up my services or skills to aid other like-minded individuals. I'm a team player, striving to make dreams a reality.</p>
