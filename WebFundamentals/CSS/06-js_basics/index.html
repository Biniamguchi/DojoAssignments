                <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a cross-platform object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximun flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (A web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript Variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="keywords">var x;</span></li>

                    <li><a href="">Variable Assignment</a>
                    Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="keywords">var x = 10</span>;
                    </li>

                    <li><a href="">Data Types</a>
                    Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on values you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are javaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="keywords">true</span> or <span class="keywords">false;</span> null - <span class="keywords">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="keywords">42</span> or <span class="keywords">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="keywords">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="keywords">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="keywords">{first_name: 'Jane',last_name: 'Doe'}</span>
                    </li>                    


                    <li><a href="">Conditionals</a>
                    When you write code you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="keywords">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="keywords">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="keywords">else</span> we execute this block of code.
                    </li>                    

                    <li><a href="">Loops</a>
                    There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: They will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop! 
                    </li>                    

                    <li><a href="">Function</a>
                    Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will call that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly, there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again. 
                    </li>                    
                </ul>
            </div>
